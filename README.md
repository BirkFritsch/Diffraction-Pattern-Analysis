# Diffraction Pattern Analysis
A tool to analyze the radius of contiouos electron diffraction ring patterns, e.g. for _in situ_ thermometry by parallel beam electron diffraction.

This is the source code for the following publication:

Moreover, it has been successfully used for temperature measurement during liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy:
