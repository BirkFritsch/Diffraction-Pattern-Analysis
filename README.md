# Diffraction Pattern Analysis
A tool to analyze the radius of contiouos SAED diffraction ring patterns, e.g. for _in situ_ thermometry by paralell beam electron diffraction.

This is the source code for the following publication:
B.Fritsch et al., "Sub-Kelvin thermometry for evaluating the local temperature stability within _in situ_ TEM gas cells", Ultramicroscopy, 2022
